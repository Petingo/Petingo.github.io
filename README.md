# Personal Website
My personal website which contains my previous works and introduction.

## Usage
The source article is saved in `_source`, using Pug template engine.
There are two bash scripts:
    1. `gen.bash`: Convert pug to html. When running this, the working directory should be in `_source`.
    2. `deploy.bash`: Add everything to git and commit + push to github.
