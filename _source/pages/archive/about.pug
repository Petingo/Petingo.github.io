        | Hello, I'm Yang Hong-Bin from Taiwan, you can also call me Petingo.
        | My passion lies in the creation of new ideas and exploring uncharted territories.
        | With interest in the 3D Computer Vision, Photography, Digital Fabrication, and MR/AR,
        | I'm currently working as a research assistant at
        | #[a(href="https://actu.epfl.ch/news/augmented-reality-as-a-tool-for-construction/") IBOIS for an AR woodworking tool] and 
        | #[a(href="https://www.epfl.ch/labs/ldm/") LDM for an AI-aided architectural design research.] #[br]

        | Due to my interest in photography, I have conducted extensive research on image processing in recent years,
        | including image and video compression, quality enhancement, and fake image detection, using both mathematical and deep learning-based methods.
        | During my undergraduate studies, I collaborated with #[a(href="http://faculty.csie.ntust.edu.tw/~klchung/") Prof. Kuo-Liang Chung] and published a paper titled
        | #[a(href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9108293&tag=1") Effective Chroma Subsampling and Luma Modification for RGB Full-color Images Using the Multiple Linear Regression Technique],
        | which beat the state-of-the-art in YUV420 chroma subsampling.

        | I am also an award-winning photographer, where I won the Special Award of the Year in 2021 Shin Kong Mitsukoshi International Photography Contest.
        | I love to capture the purity and calm of nature. Recently, I'm also trying street photography.

        | I love Architecture so much. I have taken several courses in Architecture and Interior Design when I studying my Bachelor. 
        | Although I have limited experience and skills in this field, I hope I can work in the intersection between Computer Science and Architecture in the future.
