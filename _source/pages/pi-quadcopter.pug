        h1 Pi Quadcopter
        p When I was a freshman, I collaborated with a friend in Electrical Engineering to build a quadcopter. The idea was simple: we wanted to make a quadcopter that could be controlled through Bluetooth or WiFi so that we would not need to buy an expensive RC remote controller.
        p The overall design is like this: the user uses WASD key or an Xbox 360's joystick connected to a laptop to control the drone. The computer would send the command to the Raspberry Pi on the drone through WiFi (where they would be connected to the same access point). After the Raspberry Pi receives the command, it sends the real control signal to the Multiwii board through Multiwii Serial Protocol, through a USB cable.
        p The design sounded perfect, but in reality, it was not, and the progress is not easy. For some reason, most packages send from the laptop to the Raspberry Pi were lost (where I UDP is used), and the support of Multiwii Serial Protocol was incomplete that could not fully simulate the command of an RC controller. Also, with limited experience in building a quadcopter, we could not figure out how to make the drone balanced and how to adjust the PID control. Thus, the drone couldn't really "fly", it just moved inclinedly.
        p Although it is a failed project, I still learned a lot, and I really hope I can make one again in the future.
